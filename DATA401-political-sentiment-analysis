# Analysis Questions

# 1. Compare the "like" word clouds for Trump and Obama (from lecture.) Are there similarities/differences? 
# What conclusions do you draw?

# The first thing that I noticed when it came to what people liked about Obama was that people 
# appear to like him for different reasons. This conclusion was drawn from the fact that there are a much more diverse
# distribution of what positive words were used, with the theme appearing to be rooted in what respondents saw
# as altruistic characteristics (e.g. words like change, better, care, ideas, help). On Trump's end, the likes appeared
# to be rooted less in his political qualifications, as the most commonly referenced word was 'business'.
# I would also add that although 'politician' appears fairly often, I think it actually referencing that he is no one
# Additionally, unlike Obama vs his opposition, it appears that respondents like Trump chiefly because he wasn't Hillary Clinton,
# which is indicated by the popularity of both 'hillary' and 'clinton'.

# 2. Compare the word clouds for Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton. Comment on your findings. 

# It is clear that respondents on Hillary's end trust her track record above all else. The preponderance of 
# the word 'experience' far outweighed just about every other word, with the next pertinent word being 'trump'.
# Though she would have been the first female president, I found it interesting that that and other identity-related elements
# doesn't appear to be a reason people liked her for president.

# Another interesting finding here was that the very things that respondents liked about Hillary is what they disliked
# about Trump. Experience, which played well for Hillary, was included in one of respondents' dislikes about Trump.
# The same was true when it came to elements of Hillary's identity (words like 'women'). I also noticed that 
# dislikes about Hillary had more to do with her experience as well, as the general sentiment was that she cannot
# be trusted, which is arguably a symptom of being a long term political operators. For Trump, since he has no track
# record, the dislikes focused on assumptions how he carries himself (e.g., 'seems', racist', 'personality', 'attitude')

# These differences paint a broad, yet clear picture of the dichotomy between republicans and democrats in 2016--a 
# separation that appears to exist to this day.
